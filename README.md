# Vulnerability Assessment Report
**Project Description:** I had to do a vulnerability assessment report on a given system. The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

> [!NOTE]
> **System Description:**
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest
version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is conůgured with a
stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security
measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Purpose
Questions to consider: 
1. How is the database server valuable to the business?
    + It contains all the clients information and also allows employees to access that information from around the world.
2. Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?
    + So as not to allow threat actors to gain access to possible conůdential information for clients
3. How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?
    + Workers wouldn't be able to access client information, halting productivity and the
company may be charged for compliance violations.


## Risk Assessment
| Threat Source     | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :--------: | :------: | :--: |
| Hackers           | Conduct "man-in-the-middle" attacks            | 3          |     3    |   9  |
| Competitors       | Disrupt mission-critical operations.           | 3          |     3    |   9  |
| Hacktivist        | Alter/Delete critical information              | 2          |     3    |   6  |

## Approach
Questions to consider:
1. What was your rationale for selecting the risks that you evaluated?
    + For an ecommerce business, depending on what it offers, I perceive the three likely threats sources to be Hackers, competitors, hacktivists. Hackers, competitors and hacktivists would all love to acquire customer or business data and information, learn trade secrets and definitely hinder or slow organizational growth.
2. How were you deriving the likelihood and severity scores of each risk?
    + Likelihood and severity would be based on how large the organization is, the size of its client portfolio and fiscal earnings. If database redundancy system was in place. All this would help to determine the likelihood of threat actors making an aŵempt at the organization and the severity of the threat actors actions.
3. What were the limitations of the assessment?
    + Lack of depth - Not knowing intricate application operation. And not knowing the fullscope of security controls, if any, which are currently in place.

## Remediation Strategy 
Questions to consider:
1. Which technical, operational, or managerial controls are currently implemented to secure the system?
○ No security controls were mentioned. The server is currently open to the public. Doesn't
seem as if any security plans are in place.
2. Are there security controls that can reduce the risks you evaluated? What are those controls and how
would they remediate the risks?
○ I would implement the Principle of least privilege security control. Since data is accessed
from employees and personnel all over the world, ensuring access and authorization is
set for various user accounts. Since client information is stored and accessed externally
I can only assume that PII or SPII is stored in the database. I would also implement
defense in depth security control.
● How will the results of the assessment improve the overall security of the system?
○ Implementing these security controls will ensure protection at various layers and that
only those who are to access gain access. And to also ensure that proper password
policies are utilized, network devices are properly conůgured, devices that access the
server are properly protected with antiviral/malware soųware, multifactor
authentication is set up for each user and asset classiůcation control is properly
implemented.
