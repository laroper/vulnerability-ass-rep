# Vulnerability Assessment Report
**Project Description:** I had to do a vulnerability assessment report on a given system. The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
